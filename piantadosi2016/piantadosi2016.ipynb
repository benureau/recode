The pdf is [available here](https://www.celestekidd.com/papers/PiantadosiKidd2016Extraord.pdf). Here, we only succinctly describe the model. You should consult the original article for details and for the rationale behind the model's choices.\n",

    "The spirit of this notebook is to use simple code that is easy to understand and modify. This notebook requires no specific knowledge beyond a basic grasp of the Python language. We show *all the code* of the model, without relying on any library beyond [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/). Only the plotting, using the [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/) library, have been abstracted away in the [graphs.py](https://github.com/humm/recode/blob/master/piantadosi2016/graphs.py) file. We employ the [reproducible](https://github.com/oist-cnru/reproducible) library to keep track of the computational environment and foster reproducibility.\n",

The effect is particularly important near $R = 0$, because noisy variations have all been clipped to be positive: the average value of $R$ for the population is therefore never close to zero. As in the article, however, the line plots the evolutionary trajectory starting at the beginning of the second generation, while the dot correspond to the average values of the first. This explains why some dots are disconnected from their corresponding line."

    "In the previous evolutionary model, the changes that occur between $R$ and $I$ are correlated from the parent to the child, but not between $R$ and $I$ themselves. Over multiple generations, and thus multiple iteration of these correlated changes, this allows the intelligence and the brain radius to progressively drift away from each other. With more intelligence being better (because it increases children's survival rate to adulthood), and a smaller head radius being better (because it increases birth survival rate), we would expect that the populations would take advantage of this by keeping small heads and slowly increasing their intelligence.\n",

In the following figure, the end point of the evolution of each population is displayed as a diamond.
