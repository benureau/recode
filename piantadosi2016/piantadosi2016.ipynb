The pdf is [available here](http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/ckidd/papers/PiantadosiKidd2016Extraord.pdf). Here, we only succinctly describe the model. You should consult the original article for details and for the rationale behind the model's choices.\n",

Only the plotting routines, using the [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/) library, have been abstracted away in the [graphs.py](https://github.com/humm/recode/blob/master/piantadosi2016/graphs.py) file.\n",

    "In the previous evolutionary model, the changes that occur between $R$ and $I$ are correlated from the parent to the child, but not $R$ and $I$ themselves. Over multiple generations, and thus multiple iteration of these correlated changes, this allows the intelligence and the brain radius to progressively drift away from each other. With more intelligence being better (because it increases children's survival rate to adulthood), and a smaller head radius being better (because it increases birth survival rate), we would expect that the populations would take advantage of this by keeping small heads and slowly increasing their intelligence.\n",

In the following figure, the end point of the evolution of each population is displayed as a square.
