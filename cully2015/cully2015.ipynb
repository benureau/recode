    "We recode the arm experiment of the article \"Robot that can adapt like animals\" ([DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14422)) by Antoine Cully, Jeff Clune, Danesh Tarapore and Jean-Baptiste Mouret. The article is available [on the Nature website](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14422.html), and a preprint [is available here](http://www.isir.upmc.fr/files/2015ACLI3468.pdf). The authors have made the [C++ code used for the experiments](http://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/code/ite_source_code.tar.gz) in the article available, but it was not necessary to consult it to code this Python implementation. The [supplementary information](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/extref/nature14422-s1.pdf) document, however, was instrumental to it. This code is available on the [recode github repository](https://github.com/humm/recode), and is published under the [OpenScience License](http://fabien.benureau.com/openscience.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "We won't attempt to summarize or re-explain the aims behind the experiments; we assume the reader is familiar with the article. Moreover, we only implement the arm experiment here, not the hexapod one. The main differences between this code and the one presented in the article are:\n",
    "0. We employ a kinematic, planar simulation for the robotic arm, in place of both the paper's simulation and the real robot.\n",
    "0. We do not filter self-collisions of the arm.\n",
    "0. We do restrict the working area of the arm to the camera field of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is divided in two parts: one implementing the MAP-Elites algorithm and another implementing the M-BOA optimization algorithm. The code depends on the [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), and the [bokeh]() library for the figures. The comments from the paper's pseudocode (Supplementary Figure 1) have been inserted into the code when appropriate. They are prefixed with a double \"`##`\" sign.\n",

    "The code is optimized for comprehension, not efficiency. Obvious optimization can be made, but they would reduce clarity."
